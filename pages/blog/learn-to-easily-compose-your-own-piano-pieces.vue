                <p><b>Familiarize Yourself with the Piano:</b> You don’t need any prior experience to start composing. I
                    will help you get acquainted with the keyboard, learning basic hand positions and some basic chords
                    to
                    begin experimenting with musical creation.</p>

                <p><b>Play with Chords and Scales:</b> Once you have a basic understanding of the keyboard, I will guide
                    you to start experimenting with different chords. My practical approach will allow you to discover
                    combinations of notes that you like, taking your favorite songs as a reference, thus developing your
                    musical ear.</p>

                <p><b>Improvise Freely:</b> Improvisation is an excellent way to develop your composition skills. During
                    our classes, we dedicate time for you to improvise freely, without worrying about making mistakes.
                    This playful and creative approach is essential for you to feel comfortable creating spontaneous
                    music.
                </p>

                <p><b>Creativity Development:</b> Composing and improvising allow you to explore your creativity and
                    express yourself in unique ways. This process will help you develop your own style and discover new
                    facets of your musical talent. In my classes, I foster an environment of experimentation and
                    creative
                    freedom.</p>

                <p><b>Improved Musical Understanding:</b> As you experiment with different chords, scales, and
                    progressions, your understanding of music theory will deepen. You don’t need prior formal study; I
                    will teach you the essential concepts through practice and creation, making learning natural and
                    fluid.</p>

                <p><b>Relaxation and Emotional Well-being:</b> Music has the power to influence your mood and emotional
                    well-being. Composition and improvisation can be a wonderful way to relieve stress, express
                    emotions,
                    and find a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction. My classes are designed for you to enjoy
                    the process and benefit emotionally.</p>

                <p><b>Emulating Your Favorite Compositions:</b></p>
                <p>An excellent way to learn to compose is by emulating your favorite pieces. In our classes, we will
                    analyze the songs you love together, breaking down their chords and progressions. I will teach you
                    to
                    play parts of these pieces on the piano and incorporate those elements into your own compositions.
                    This method is not only educational but also inspiring and motivating.</p>

                <p><b>
                        Connecting with Other Musicians:</b></p>
                <p>Once you feel more comfortable composing and improvising, I encourage you to share your music with
                    others. I offer opportunities to play in groups, participate in recitals, and collaborate with other
                    students. Musical collaboration can inspire you and take your creativity to new heights, as well as
                    provide you with a rich social experience.</p>

                <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
                <p>Learning to compose and improvise on the piano is accessible to everyone, and I am here to guide you
                    every step of the way. From creativity development to emotional well-being, these skills can enrich
